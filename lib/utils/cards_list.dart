        "Com base em milhares de páginas dos impressionantes cadernos que Leonardo manteve ao longo de boa parte da vida e nas mais recentes descobertas sobre sua obra e sua trajetória, Walter Isaacson, biógrafo de Einstein e Steve Jobs, tece uma narrativa que conecta arte e ciência, revelando faces inéditas da história de Leonardo. Desfazendo-se da aura de super-humano muitas vezes atribuída ao artista, Isaacson mostra que a genialidade de Leonardo estava fundamentada em características bastante palpáveis, como a curiosidade, uma enorme capacidade de observação e uma imaginação tão",
